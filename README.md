## Exercises

Each exercise is a Bash script (`.sh` file) that you can run in your terminal. The exercises are designed to help you practice various aspects of Bash scripting, from basic commands to more complex scripting techniques.

### Running an Exercise

To run an exercise, navigate to the appropriate folder and execute the script. For example, to run the first basic exercise:
